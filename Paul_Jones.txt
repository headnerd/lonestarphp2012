Paying Off Technical Debt
-like paying off financial debt
-get the stuff first, but have to pay for it eventually
-no easy way out : either suffer as things are or suffer through change
OPTIONS: 
1) Big-Bang Approach : rewrite	-> effort = estimate x 2, with next higher unit (eg. est = 2 mos, time = 4 years)
2) Incremental Approach - small changes across entire code base; like paying off a loan; keep the application running the whole time
STEPS
a) Convert as much as you can to classes and remove includes
b) Convert to dependency injection as much as possible
Dep Inj => instead of reaching out from inside of class to grab dependency, declare the dependency inside the class and pull the dependency into the class
