=> many starting to use Hypermedia APIs now

Current State of REST APIs
*most REST APIs are basically data
*make request for URL (that you have to know ahead of time)
*read the properties/data sent back
*many APIs starting to include url
*PROBLEM: no set way to link resources in JSON/XML
*people trying to create media types/formats to link resources

NEW FORMAT - HAL :: Hypertext Application Language
includes named key called "_links"
EX:
{
	{
		_links: {
			self: {href: "http://budgetapp.dev/budgets/73"}
		}
	...
	...
	}
}

*now we can write a script to capture the _links and iterate
*links are nice, but they are still READ-ONLY, and API docs are still REQUIRED

Levels of APIs
0 - The Swamp of POX (Plain Old XML)
	*think XML-RPC type interface
	*always posted to single URL
	*can cache POST requests
1 - Resources
	*adding in different URLs (e.g. /blog, /posts/12)
2 - HTTP Verbs
	*where most frameworks sit today (GET, POST, PUT, DESTROY)
3 - Hypermedia Controls
	*interlinking, rich data in the API
	*Level 3 is a pre-condition of REST -> everything else is "wrong"
	*Roy T. Fielding => http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven

You MUST have hypermedia controls to be considered RESTful
*the API should provide/drive every choice available, users only responsible for making choices

WHAT ARE THESE HYPERMEDIA CONTROLS?
1 - LINKS
2 - FORMS * these are tricky

*for forms, use JSON Schema or URI templates (using tokens, similar to routing) or HAL specification
HAL really only deals with links right now, basically read-only now
*HAL requires you to maintain state on the client

Link "rel" Types
-self
-next
-search

**NO OFFICIAL SPEC FOR LINKING OR DESCRIBING RESOURCES FOR JSON/XML
->will likely need to combine 2 or 3 to achieve desired goal

DEMO TIME
-using both JSON Schema and HAL Spec for app
-mobile demo app built with Titanium
-demo shows "power" of hypermedia
-it's about the client assuming NOTHING
-all the client does is know the format and parse the data

Any frameworks for helping switch? => no
